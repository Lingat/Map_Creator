# Description
The map creator is a project I made so it can be easier for me to create map arrays for any games I want to make with HTML5.
I don't know if this is already a thing but I'm gonna go ahead and make it anyway

# Usage
Right now, there's nothing much on it so you'll just have to wait.

# Todo
  - [X] Add options bar
  
  - [X] Add eraser tool to options bar
  
  - [ ] Add different squares to options bar
  
  - [ ] Add input values to change amount of squares and canvas sizing
  
  - [ ] Add an output bar to see what created array map looks like in code

# Known bugs
  - When you change your colour, all other squares change colour too
